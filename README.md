# Interactive Computing with Jupyter Notebook [Video]
This is the code repository for [Interactive Computing with Jupyter Notebook [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/interactive-computing-jupyter-notebook-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789531503), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Python is one of the leading open source platforms for data science and numerical computing. IPython and the associated Jupyter Notebook offer efficient interfaces to Python for data analysis and interactive visualization, and they constitute an ideal gateway to the platform.

Interactive Computing with Jupyter Notebook, contains many ready-to-use, focused recipes for high-performance scientific computing and data analysis, from the latest IPython/Jupyter features to the most advanced tricks, to help you write better and faster code. This course covers programming techniques: code quality and reproducibility, code optimization, high-performance computing through just-in-time compilation, parallel computing, and graphics card programming.

In short, you will master relatively advanced methods in interactive numerical computing, high-performance computing, and data visualization.
